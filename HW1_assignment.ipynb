    "A few notes about this homework:\n",
    "1. This homework is purposefully heavy in using the Pandas package. Being able to explore data is an essential data science skill that you'll use throughout this class and your career -- even if the polling/politics application is not interesting to you. I encourage you to practice Pandas and learn how to use it well. Your code will NOT be graded on efficiency.\n",
    "2. Some of the questions can be interpreted in multiple ways. That is always true in data science. You'll need to make judgment calls for what analysis to do. For the homework, you'll still receive full points for any \"reasonable\" choice. Also feel free to ask questions on EdStem. \n",

In many hypotheses, some unmeasured confoundings might lead to differential non-response; that is, people who have bad experiences may prefer not to reply with a rating or people are kind and don't want to hurt others' livelihood. Rating inflation makes the rating system biased, which is not helpful for users to figure out good sellers from bad ones. Also, sellers may be more likely to feel competitive and, therefore, push explicit pressure on buyers in turn. "

    "<font color='blue'> The above techniques use the mean answer among people who share a demographic as the estimate for that demographic. But that wastes information _across_ demographics. For example, maybe people who only have \"Some College\" are similar enough to people who have \"High School\" as to provide some useful information. \n",

    "Here, you will earn partial bonus points by just reporting the predictions and comparing them to the means of each covariate group in the raw polling data. Give a scatter-plot, where each point is one combination of full demographics (age, gender, party, race/ethnicity, education), the X axis is the raw polling average for that combination, and the Y axis is your regression prediction for that combination.   \n",

    "### 5) Bonus points (up to 2 points): Implement full \"raking\" using all the demographic covariates, i.e., match all the marginals without assuming independence, as opposed to just one or two marginal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'> Hint: at the heart of raking is calculating a weight for each survey respondent, so that the weights, when summed up, matches the population on desired marginals as much as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a survey with two respondents, A likes chocolate and B hates chocolate. We know that in the population, 80\\% of people like chocolate (the number is made up). So in a representative sample with 2 respondents, we would expect to see 1.6 respondents who like chocolate. Thus, one possible thing to do is we assign A with weight 1.6 and B with weight 0.4, and then use these weights to weigh their answers to the question we care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, when the number of respondents and the number of demographic dimensions that we want to match get larger, finding the weights itself becomes harder. There are mainly two ways to do this. The first is through an iterative approach known as Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF). IPF iterates through each demographic variable at a time, and adjusts the weights of all respondents through post stratification. IPF is easier to implement by hand by just following the instructions. The second approach is known as generalized raking, which is done through solving an optimization problem, and proposed by [Deville, J. C., Särndal, C. E., & Sautory, O. (1993)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1993.10476369). This approach attempts to solve one undesirable outcome of IPF that the resulting weights may be unbalanced, which leads to higher variance in the final estimate. [This blog post](https://dev.to/potloc/generalized-raking-for-survey-weighting-2d1d) gives a nice introduction to generalized raking, while providing a code snippet for implementing it in Python (you will have to make suitable changes, of course.)"
